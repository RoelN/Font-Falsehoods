# Falsehoods programmers believe about fonts

This is a list of [falsehoods programmers believe in](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood). Got something to add? Please [file an issue](https://github.com/RoelN/Font-Falsehoods/issues) or tweet at [@pixelambacht](https://twitter.com/pixelambacht)!

Excluded from this list are falsehoods that also live outside the programming world (e.g. "font" and "typeface" mean the same thing) or general falsehoods about typography (e.g. serif fonts are more legible than sans serif fonts).

The "falsehoods programmers believe"-format doesn't provide explanations and tries to pique your curiosity enough to do your own research. Regardless, I'll try to add explanations soon. If you want to know more or wonder why an item is on the list, [tweet your questions at me!](https://twitter.com/pixelambacht)
